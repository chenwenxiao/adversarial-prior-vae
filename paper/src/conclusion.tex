\section{Conclusion}

We propose a novel learnable prior, Pull-back Prior, for VAE, by adjusting the prior with a discriminator assessing the quality of data, with a solid derivation and an intuitive explanation. We propose an efficient and stable training method for VAE with Pull-back Prior, by mixing the optimizations of WGAN and VAE into one. VAEPP is evaluated on common datasets, and shows impressive performance in log-likelihood and quality of sampling. We believe that this paper could lead VAE models into a new stage, with a clear formula, a general framework and powerful performance.
