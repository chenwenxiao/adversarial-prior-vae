\section{Conclusion}

We propose a novel learnable prior Pull-back Prior for VAE model with solid inference, which rise a novel analysis direction DMA to construct new priors. Based on the inference of Pull-back Prior, we propose the Naive training method for VAE with Pull-back Prior. VAEPP is presented to overcome the unstability of training, by mixing the optimizations of WGAN and VAE into one optimization. VAEPP is evaluated on vast common dataset, and shows impressive performance in log-likelihood and quality of sampling. We believe that this paper could lead VAE models into a new stage, with clear formula, general framework and powerful performance.
