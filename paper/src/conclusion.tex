\section{Conclusion}

We propose a novel learnable prior Pull-back Prior for VAE model, by adjusting prior with a discriminator assessing the quality of data, with solid inference and intuitive explanation. We propose an efficient and stable training method for VAE with Pull-back Prior, by mixing the optimizations of WGAN and VAE into one. VAEPP is evaluated on vast common dataset, and shows impressive performance in log-likelihood and quality of sampling. We believe that this paper could lead VAE models into a new stage, with clear formula, general framework and powerful performance.
