\section{Conclusion}

We propose a novel learnable prior Pull-back Prior for VAE model with solid inference, which rise a novel analysis direction DMA to construct new priors. Based on the inference of Pull-back Prior, we propose the Naive training method for VAE with Pull-back Prior and an improvement of such training method. They are evaluated  on vast common dataset, and shows powerful performance in log-likelihood and quality of sampling. We believe that this paper could lead VAE models into a new stage, with clear formula, general framework and powerful performance.
