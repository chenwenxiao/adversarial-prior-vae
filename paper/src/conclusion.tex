\section{Conclusion}

We propose a novel learnable prior, Pull-back Prior, for VAE, by adjusting the prior through a discriminator assessing the quality of data, with a solid derivation and an intuitive explanation. We propose an efficient and stable training method for VAEPP, by mixing the optimizations of WGAN and VAE into one. VAEPP shows impressive performance in log-likelihood and quality of sampling on common datasets. We believe that VAEPP could lead VAE models into a new stage, with clearer formula, more general framework and better performance.
