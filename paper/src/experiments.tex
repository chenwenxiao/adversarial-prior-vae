\section{Experiments}
We test VAEPP in vast common datasets including MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10 and CELEBA. 
We will firstly use some experiments to show the selection of hyper-parameters in CIFAR-10. And then we will test the performance on other dataset without fine-turn hyper-parameters. In the 2nd subsection, we will show the quality of sampling. In the 3rd subsection, we will show how VAEPP solve the out-of-distribution problem.
